Conway's Game of Life
=====================

This is a simple implementation of the game of life in javascript using
Processing.JS and the goal was to explore a bit with the library and
also to provide a way of easily sharing GoL patterns.

Everytime the board is paused or manually changed, the URL is updated to
reflect the current state of the game, so if you want your friends to
see the awesome new pattern you created, you can just grab the URL and
share away.

Here are some examples:

- [Glider][]
- [Pulsar][]
- [Queen Bee Shuttle][]
