{"name":"Conway's Game of Life","body":"### Welcome to the Game of Life!\r\nThe goal of the Game of Life is to observe the nature evolve! There can be anything from order to chaos, from random to complexity. You interact with the game by creating an initial state and observing how it evolves. Every square can be either dead or alive and they follow very simple rules:\r\n\r\n* Live Square:\r\n  1. If there are two or three live surrounding neighbors, it will stay alive :D\r\n  2. Any other number of live neighbors will make it perish :(\r\n* Dead Square:\r\n  1. If there are exactly three live surrounding neighbors, it will flourish :D\r\n  2. Any other number of live neighbors will have no effect :(\r\n\r\n### (Very) Brief History\r\nThe Game of Life is a cellular automaton created by, lo and behold, John Conway in 1970 and the original version is a zero-player game, meaning there is no interaction after setting the initial state, also called _seed_ (although this version is slightly different in which the current state can be on the fly). \r\n\r\n### Interesting Patterns\r\nMany different types of patterns occur during the evolution of a given state, many of which were discovered without computers, using paper, blackboards, or game boards (this is a nice exercise to try at home). Here are some interesting ones:\r\n\r\n#### Still Lifes\r\n\r\n* [Block](#2o$2o!)\r\n* [Beehive](#bo$obo$obo$bo!)\r\n* [Loaf](#b2o$o2bo$bobo$2bo!)\r\n* [Boat](#2o$obo$bo!)\r\n\r\n#### Oscilators\r\n\r\n* [Blinker](#bo$bo$bo!)\r\n* [Toad](#$b3o$3o!)\r\n* [Beacon](#2o$2o$2b2o$2b2o!)\r\n* [Pulsar](#$3b3o3b3o$$bo4bobo4bo$bo4bobo4bo$bo4bobo4bo$3b3o3b3o$$3b3o3b3o$bo4bobo4bo$bo4bobo4bo$bo4bobo4bo$$3b3o3b3o!)\r\n\r\n#### Spaceships\r\n\r\n* [Glider](#bo$2bo$3o!)\r\n* [Lightweight Spaceship](#$b4o$o3bo$4bo$o2bo!)\r\n* [Queen Bee Shuttle](#9bo12b$7bobo12b$6bobo13b$2o3bo2bo11b2o$2o4bobo11b2o$7bobo12b$9bo!)\r\n* [Queen Bee Loop](#12bo11b$12bobo9b$13bobo8b$13bo2bo7b$13bobo8b$12bobo9b$12bo11b$3bo20b$2bobo19b$bo3bo18b$2b3o19b$2o3b2o17b$17b2o3b2o$19b3o2b$18bo3bob$19bobo2b$20bo3b$11bo12b$9bobo12b$8bobo13b$7bo2bo13b$8bobo13b$9bobo12b$11bo!)\r\n* [Dragon](#12bo16b$12b2o14bo$10bob2o5bobo4b2ob$5bo3bo3b3o2bo4bo5b$2o3bo2bo6bobo5b3o2bo$2o3bob2o6bo3bobobo5b$2o3bo10bobo7b2ob$5b2o14bo6bo$7bo12bobo6b$7bo12bobo6b$5b2o14bo6bo$2o3bo10bobo7b2ob$2o3bob2o6bo3bobobo5b$2o3bo2bo6bobo5b3o2bo$5bo3bo3b3o2bo4bo5b$10bob2o5bobo4b2ob$12b2o14bo$12bo!)\r\n* [Gosper Glider Gun](#24bo$22bobo$12b2o6b2o12b2o$11bo3bo4b2o12b2o$2o8bo5bo3b2o$2o8bo3bob2o4bobo$10bo5bo7bo$11bo3bo$12b2o!)\r\n\r\n#### Other Patterns\r\n\r\n[LifeWiki](http://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/) has tons of other patterns that were found throughout the years.
